# XTCryptoSignals

**XTCryptoSignals** is a Python library that includes the following 3 services:

* #### Ticker

    * **Data collection** of crypto-currencies pairs such as BTC/USDT, ETH/BTC or any other pair that is supported by the Exchange API
    * A **Signals** service based on setup rules to send real-time alerts about price, price change, trading volume or market sentiment through E-mail or Push Notifications to the browser or mobile app
    * **Automatic trading**

* #### RESTFul Server API
    * Restful interface that exposes API entry points to get desired crypto-currencies data.
    * SocketIO Server to broadcast real-time data to clients.

* #### Website

## Ticker
### Start service

Development:

```bash
xt-ticker --enable-messaging

# to test 1 tick
xt-ticker --testing

```

Production

```bash
xt-ticker --enable-messaging --log-minimal
```

```bash
xt-ticker --list-config exchanges
```
```bash
binance
binance_dex
uphold
okex
idex
switcheo
hotbit
bibox
okcoin
bithumb

Command line help
```bash
xt-ticker --help
```
```bash
Usage: xt-ticker [OPTIONS]

  Use this tool to collect data from configured coins or/and tokens from
  configured crypto-currencies exchanges.

Options:
  --testing                       Execute 1 iteration for all configured coins
                                  and/or tokens without Celery. (Useful for
                                  testing purposes)
  --list-config [exchanges|currencies]
                                  List 'exchanges' or 'currencies' (coins or
                                  tokens) per exchange that the tool currently
                                  supports.
  --enable-messaging              Enable real-time crypto data message broadcasting.
  --log-minimal                   Only log errors and important warnings in
                                  stdout.
  --version                       Show version.
  -h, --help                      Show this message and exit.
```

### Setup

There is already an initial setup with some crypto-currencies (coins and tokens) that can be added or/and removed in [settings_exchanges.py](xtcryptosignals/settings_exchanges.py).

```python
BIBOX: {
    'pairs': [
        ('ONT', 'USDT'),
        ('ONT', 'BTC'),
        ('ONT', 'ETH'),
        ('NEO', 'USDT'),
        ('NEO', 'BTC'),
        ('NEO', 'ETH'),
        ('LTC', 'USDT'),
        ('LTC', 'BTC'),
        ('CARD', 'ETH'),
    ]
}

UPHOLD: {
    'pairs': [
        ('BTC', 'USD'),
        ('ETH', 'USD'),
        ('LTC', 'USD'),
        ('XRP', 'USD'),
    ]
}
```

Initial setup to create dynamic MongoDB collections for data segmentation categorized by Exchanges pooling frequency in [settings.py](xtcryptosignals/settings.py).
```python
HISTORY_FREQUENCY = (
    '10s', '30s', '1m', '10m', '30m', '1h', '2h', '3h', '4h', '12h', '1d', '4d', 
    '1w', '2w', '4w', '12w', '24w', '1y',
)
```

### Results
The Ticker service is highly performant as can take advantage of multi-processing multi-core CPU.  

### RESTFul Server API
### Start service

Development:

```bash
xt-server
```

Production:

```bash
DEBUG=0 xt-server
```


## Website
### Start service

Development:

```bash
xt-client
```

Production:
```bash
# if using default settings
DEBUG=0 SERVER_API_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:5000 GA_TRACKING_ID=UA-xxxxxxxxx-x xt-client --gunicorn
```
`SERVER_API_BASE_URL` should contain the public address where `xt-server` was started.  
(all environment variables are optional)

## Run all services at once

```bash
xt-all --help
```

```bash
Usage: xt-all [OPTIONS] [start|stop|restart]

Options:
  -h, --help  Show this message and exit.
```
